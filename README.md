## Intro
Welcome to my blog application. I used tutorials and references to build this as one of my first React applications. I really enjoyed creating this, and will be adding in my own functionality as time goes on.

This application utilizes a local db.json file where it stores and retrieves blog posts as JSON objects. 

## How to

### Run the app 
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Run the local JSON server

npx json-server data/db.json --port <desired port number>
